# STUDIUM

**STUDIUM** is an open-source study management tool focused on real metrics, consistency, and disciplined work — not on artificial motivation or gamification.

The project aims to function as a **personal study tracking system**, bringing together scheduling, focus sessions, habits, and objective metrics in a simple, functional, and classic Web2-style interface.

This project was developed as part of a technical portfolio and is under continuous improvement.

## Project Philosophy

STUDIUM is built on a few core principles:

- Studying is a measurable process
- Consistency matters more than motivation
- Metrics should reflect reality, not comfort the user
- Tools should support the student, not distract them

Because of this, the project deliberately avoids:
- Excessive gamification
- Social rankings or peer comparison
- Decorative UI elements without practical value
